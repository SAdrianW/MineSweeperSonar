# MineSweeper Project 1

## SonarSweeper
Functionaly the same as regular minesweeper, SonarSweeper takes on a nautical and Naval theme, inspired by the Battle for the Atlantic in WWII primarily between England and Germany.

The objective of SonarSweeper is to clear the current ocean of submerged threats. This is achived by clicking on a cell co-ordinate to reveal if there is anything under the waves. If there is nothing; well done, cell cleared and this result will flood out to fill all adjacent cells until a sonar return is registered and a number is displayed.  A numbered square represents how many hidden threats are adjacent. It is your task to use your logical deduction skills (or sheer luck) to figure out which cell/s contain the treats and flag them with your sonar.  Beware though, if you enter a cell with a submarine in it then its game over for you. Once you have located all threats then your task in this sector is over, and you will be given cake.

For further enquiries please see the Office of Naval Construction here [link](https://github.com/SAdrianW/MineSweeperSonar).


### Further Development
There are more features that could be implemented, some of which were cut from this version due to lack of skill and/or time.

Planned Features
- Timer. So you can see how long it takes to clear a sector (or explode).
- Sonar flag count. To make clearing a bit more organised.
- Sonar flag charges. To provide additional challenges by limiting available flags.
- Audio. Background music for entertainment and audible feed back for sonar pings and explosions.
- Additonal difficulties. Larger more dangerous sectors to be cleared.
- Sonar cone variant sectors. A visual update to give more of a sonar vibe.
